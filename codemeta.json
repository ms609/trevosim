In brief, these include:\n\n-- New character options\n-- New default simulation parameters\n-- Ecosystem engineering functionality\n-- An expanding playing field mode\n-- New logging capabilities\n-- The option to match fitness peaks across environments\n-- A no selection mode\n-- Mixing of organisms between playing fields\n-- Perturbations (periods of accelerated environmental change)\n-- The ability to run the simulation for a user-defined number of iterations, as opposed to for set number of species\n-- Abstraction of the fitness algorithm from the genome via many-to-one mapping (stochastic layer)\n-- A test suite integrated into the software build",
